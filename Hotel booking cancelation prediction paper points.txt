Hotel booking cancelation prediction using tree based models

Abstract
Booking cancellation every year causes diminising revenue for the hotels/service industry. to combat this forcasting number of cancellation during different season based on data help mitigate this issue. implimenting tree based machine learning algoritham to make predictions. also by learning and tuning the hyperparameter like depth and number of trees, which affect these prediction help improve the confidence of the model.

Introductions

Dataset
The data was taken from the website kaggle. it contains 19 features and 36275 bookings for the years 2017 and 2018. other than the lead time feature all the features are categorical.

	Data Preprocessing
		Before the data can be used it needs to be cheaked and cleaned so that the machine learning model can perform well. the following step have been done on the dataset
Removing entries with NaN
Removing duplicate entries
Removing outliers
